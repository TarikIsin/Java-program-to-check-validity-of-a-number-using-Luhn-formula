# Java-program-to-check-validity-of-a-number-using-Luhn-formula

  This Java program checks if a user inputted number is valid according to the Luhn formula. It takes in the input from the user, validates it, and then checks if the number is valid by calculating the DNumber and LNumber according to the Luhn formula. The program then outputs whether the number is valid or not. The code also includes error handling for invalid input, such as non-digit characters and too short input.
